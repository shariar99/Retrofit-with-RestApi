# Retrofit-with-RestApi



JSONArrayApp is a  application that demonstrates how to retrieve and display a nested JSON array using Retrofit and RecyclerView.

## Features

- Makes an API call using Retrofit to retrieve a JSON response.
- Parses the JSON response using GsonConverterFactory.
- Displays the data in a RecyclerView with a custom adapter.
- Handles API call errors and failures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shariar99/Retrofit-with-RestApi.git
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Configuration
Update the baseUrl in the MainActivity class to your actual API base URL:


    ```retrofit As Retrofit = New Retrofit.Builder() _
     .baseUrl("https://your-api-base-url.com/") _
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()) _
     .build()
Ensure that the API response matches the structure of the YourResponseModel and Topping classes. Modify them accordingly if needed.
